# **Merry-Swap**


### **Description**

A full stack application with persistent data using MySQL.  The application greets you with a polished frontend. The user can a) login or b) sign up to create a profile. Once the user is a member they are allowed to post a gift they would like to exchange with another member. They can browse current items that are available to exchange with their own gift. They can contact the user by selecting the item they are interested in. If they do not find anything that is in their interest, they can leave their item on display until a member reaches out to them.
